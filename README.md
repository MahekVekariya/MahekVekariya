### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**MahekVekariya/MahekVekariya** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on automation testing and practicing it in selenium with Python. Also have good experience in working as Manual QA.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning automation testing in Playwright with JS.

Everything else will be updated later on.
